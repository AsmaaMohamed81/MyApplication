<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Over the past decade, legal wagering has expanded rapidly in North America. In 1998 alone, people lost 50 billion dollars in legal betting and it is estimated that illegal wagering is twice that amount. A recent government report, based on the broadest population survey, concludes that the lifetime and pathological gamblers in the U.S. range between 4 and 10 million persons and is growing. If we include the families affected by problem gambling then the potential impact is indeed prodigious. Virtually no community in the U.S. and Canada is left untouched by entertainment or problem gambling. Treating problem gambling has evolved from a small group of practitioners in the 1980's working in specialty impatient units into an international enterprise that affects the caseload of many mental health professionals. Owing to its quiet origins, problem gambling treatment strategies are not well known throughout the clinical community. Consequently the average clinician is him/herself "learning as they go." This approach does not benefit either client or therapist. As the book's first chapter makes clear, problem gambling differs significantly from substance abuse, its nearest clinical relative. Not attending to these differences leads to poor results and clinical failure. This book is the one essential tool needed by clinicians treating or likely to treat problem gambling. Written by a clinician with wide experience, it is intended for the general clinician treating or likely to treat problem gambling desiring a comprehensive, yet user-friendly guide. Key Features * Assessment and treatment of problem gambling and those affected by it is discussed * Includes diagnostic instruments developed by the author * An integrative approach is taken with a special focus on cultural concerns and clinical applications for women and minorities * Integration of spirituality in treatment is covered.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>This manual is an advanced-level textbook and is intended to be an addition at just this advanced level to the literature of general as well as child psychology. The book is presented as a series of separate chapters, each written by a recognized authority. Its purpose is to provide an accurate and coherent picture of some of the most important aspects of research in the scientific psychology of human development. Until comparatively recent years most of those who wrote upon the development of individual mental life elaborated essentially speculative theories. They attempted to describe man's so-called inborn instincts or the allegedly tabula rasa character of the mind of the young child. The present book is testimony to the fact that today psychologists and other scientists by the use of appropriate techniques have established a large body of important and reliable facts concerning the details of human mental development. Many practical as well as theoretical gains have resulted from the empirical study of the growth of the human mind. It will be clear to the reader of these chapters that it has been possible to formulate hypotheses concerning many specific aspects of mental development. These hypotheses have in many instances been tested in the laboratory or in controlled and quantifiable social situations. The conclusions so reached are very different from the vague verbal theories of the prescientific era of child psychology. One who is interested mainly in securing an understanding of adult mental life can gain many new insights into mental processes in general from a study of these chapters. A knowledge of the way in which adult psychological characteristics develop in each individual is fundamental to a complete understanding of such characteristics. The manual may thus be thought of as a factual introduction to the understanding not only of child psychology but also of the psychology of the normal adult human mind and even of the abnormal human mind.
